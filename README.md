Explored the intricacies of Docker Containers through a practical application. This project showcases a Node.js application that captures user data and stores it in MongoDB, all operating within Docker containers. It utilizes MongoDB for database management and Mongo-Express as a database UI, with both containers sourced from Docker Hub. The Node.js app is containerized using a custom Dockerfile, and its network, ports, and environment variables are adeptly managed via a YAML file in Docker Compose. Key features include the creation and configuration of a dedicated network, facilitating seamless container interactions. The project extends into AWS territory, employing AWS Elastic Container Registry to maintain a private repository for image storage. A pivotal aspect is the implementation of Docker Volumes for data persistence, exploring and integrating three distinct types. This repository is a comprehensive guide to employing Docker technologies in a real-world application.
